To find the home directory of your Java installation on a Red Hat server, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or SSH into your Red Hat server.

2. Run the following command to check the available Java installations:

   ```
   sudo alternatives --config java
   ```

   This command lists all the installed Java versions and prompts you to select the default one by entering a number. The selected version will have a `*` symbol next to it.

3. Once you've identified the default Java version, run the following command to determine its installation path:

   ```
   readlink -f $(which java)
   ```

   This command will display the absolute path to the `java` executable.

Alternatively, if you have root access or administrative privileges, you can use the `whereis` command to locate the Java installation directory. Run the following command:

```
whereis java
```

This command will provide the location of the `java` binary, which should be within the Java installation directory.

Note that the specific paths may vary depending on the Java version and the installation method used on your Red Hat server.
